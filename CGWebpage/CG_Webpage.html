        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>In "Echoes of the Realm," players navigate a dynamic, living world where every action and decision significantly alters the environment and storyline.</p>
        <p>My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in computer science, focusing on game design, development, and programming languages like C++ and Unity.</p>
        <p>As players interact with characters, complete quests, and explore diverse landscapes, they will witness the immediate and long-term consequences of their actions.</p>
        <p>Towns may flourish or fall into ruin, landscapes can transform, and alliances shift, offering a unique and evolving narrative with each playthrough.</p>
